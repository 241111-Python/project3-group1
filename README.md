# Project 3: Crime Rate Analysis

## Overview

This large-scale data analysis and visualization project leverages diverse datasets spanning themes such as economic, social, and environmental factors to highlight correlations between these variables and crime rates across the United States over a period of several decades. The project seeks to uncover unique patterns and correlations that may shed light on the drivers of criminal activity, with an aim of better understanding how various overlooked factors may influence crime rates. Specific relationships that this analysis would examine pertain to pollution and climate change, elections, global trends, and stock market prices.
