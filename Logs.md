_ create requirements.txt file (don't forget to do install them), or update them if you install new modules
_ current modules: Pandas and matplotlib
_ create main.py file to run our application
_ create library.py file to store our functions and methods (maybe even classes)
_ include the dataset I found. (it might be good share our datasets to have a bigger pool of datasets to choose from)
